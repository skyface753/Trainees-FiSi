# Boot-Stick

You should know how to create a boot-stick.

A boot-stick is a USB stick, from which you can start a computer. This is useful, if you want to install a new operating system on your computer.

You need a USB-Stick, a operating system and a software to create the boot-stick.

## USB-Stick

You can use any USB-Stick, but you should watch out for the size. The size of the USB-Stick should be at least the size of the iso file of the operating system.

## Operating System

You need a operating system, which you want to install on your computer. You can download the iso file from the website of the operating system.

For example, if you want to install Ubuntu, you can download the iso file from the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

## Software (Rufus)

You need a software to create the boot-stick. There are many different software available, but we will focus on [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/).

## Create Boot-Stick

1. Download the iso file of the operating system
2. Download Rufus
3. Start Rufus
4. Select the USB-Stick
5. Select the iso file
6. Start the process

## Boot from USB-Stick

After you created the boot-stick, you can boot from it. This is **different** for every computer (especially by the manufacturer). On most computers you can press `F12` during the boot process to select the boot device. On some computers you have to change the boot order in the BIOS.

You can find the right key for your computer by searching for it on the internet.

## Install Operating System

After you booted from the boot-stick, you can install the operating system on your computer. This is **different** for every operating system you want to install. Most of the time you just have to follow the instructions on the screen.
