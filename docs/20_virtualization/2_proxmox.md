# Proxmox

Now that we are familiar with the basics of virtualization, let's look at some of the popular virtualization platforms.

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) is a virtualization platform. It gets installed directly on the hardware and provides a web interface to manage the virtual machines (VMs) and containers (LXCs).

!!! note

    Proxmox is a operating system, so you can't use it in parallel to another operating system. (But you can install Proxmox on a VM.)

## Install

Please follow the [official installation guide](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/get-started).
