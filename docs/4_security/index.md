# Security

[Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) are great places to learn about
security. You can create an account and then hack into several machines to learn about security.

In order to start a good resource is [OWASP Top ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) which regularly lists the ten most prominent vulnerabilities in web. 
Each vulnerability comes with an explanation.

Furthermore, linux distributions like [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) or [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/) comes with plenty of tools which come in handy when learning and exerting security.
