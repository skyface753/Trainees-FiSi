# Wireshark

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. It is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many industries and educational institutions.

You can use it, to analyze the network traffic of your applications. This is useful, if you want to know, what your application is doing in the background. For example, you can see, if your application is sending data to a server.
