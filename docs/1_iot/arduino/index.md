## What is Arduino?

Arduino is an microcontroller platform that is used to build electronic devices. It is a very popular platform for hobbyists and students. It's like a mini computer, without a screen or keyboard. It has a lot of inputs and outputs, so you can connect it to sensors and actuators.

!!! info

    It can only run one program at a time. It is not a general purpose computer.

## Getting started

You should already got an Arduino Mega 2560 from your instructor. If not, ask him.

There should also be a book with some starter projects. It contains a lot of simple projects to get familiar with the Arduino.

Otherwise you can find a pdf version of the book [here](https://funduino.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Anleitungen-deutsch-12-2016.pdf).

Please do at least these projects:

- [Blink](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/Blink)
- [DigitalReadSerial](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/DigitalReadSerial)
- [Traffic Light](https://funduino.de/nr-45-arduino-ampel)
