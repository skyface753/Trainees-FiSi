# Introduction

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. It is about creating algorithms that can learn from data. The goal is to create algorithms that can make predictions based on the data.

## Getting started

To get started with Machine Learning, you should complete (more or less) the [google course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro). I would recommend to complete at least till the [**Classification: Thresholding**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/thresholding) section.
