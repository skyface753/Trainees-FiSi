## Introduction

Monitoring is the process of observing and checking the progress of a system or program during its execution. It is essential to ensure that the system is running smoothly and to identify any issues that may arise. Monitoring can help to identify performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and other problems that may affect the system's performance.

## What can be monitored?

There are many aspects of a system that can be monitored, including:

- **Performance**: Monitoring the performance of the system can help to identify bottlenecks and other issues that may be affecting the system's performance.
