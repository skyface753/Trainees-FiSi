# Packages

Most Software Tools are provided as packages. A package is a collection of files and directories that are bundled together.

There are hundreds of so-called package-managers available, which are tools that help you to install, update, configure, and remove software packages.

The most popular package managers are:

- **PiP** (Python)
- **npm** (Node.js)
- **brew** (macOS)
