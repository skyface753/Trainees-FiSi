# Cassandra (advanced)

Cassandra is a NoSQL database that is designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.

So you can say it is the big brother of MongoDB, but it is more advanced and used in the industry. It is also a document based database, but it is more flexible and faster.
