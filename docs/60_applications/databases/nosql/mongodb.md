# MongoDB

Is a document-oriented database, which means that instead of storing data in tables made out of individual rows, it stores data in collections made out of individual documents. Documents are analogous to JSON objects but exist in the database in a more type-rich format known as BSON. MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.
