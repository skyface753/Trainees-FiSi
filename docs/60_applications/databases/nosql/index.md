# NoSQL

NoSQL databases in contrast to SQL databases are not relational. They are document based and store data in JSON format. This makes them very flexible and easy to use. They are also very fast and can handle large amounts of data.

## Why NoSQL?

NoSQL databases are very easy to use and are used in many applications. For example, if you want to create a website with some data (**without relations**), you can use NoSQL to store the data.
