## Why do we need databases?

Normally, when we create data in a program, it is stored in the memory of the computer. But when the program is closed, the data is lost. To prevent this, we need a database. The database stores the data on the hard drive of the computer, so it is not lost when the program is closed.

### Why not just use files?

You could just use files to store data, but that would be very inefficient. You would have to write a lot of code to read and write the data from the files. You would also have to write a lot of code to search for data in the files. Databases are much more efficient than files.

They also structure the data in a way that makes it easier to work with. For example, if you have a database of customers, you can easily find all the customers who live in a certain city, or all the customers who have bought a certain product.
