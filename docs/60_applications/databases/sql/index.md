# SQL

SQl is a database language used to create, read, update and delete data from a database.

SQL = Structured Query Language

## Why SQL?

SQL is a very important language, because it is used in many applications. For example, if you want to create a website with users (**with relations**), you can use SQL to store the users in a database.

With SQL you can create relations in your database. This means, that you can connect data from different tables. For example, you can create a table with `users` and a table with `posts`. Now you can connect the `posts` to the `users` with a relation. This allows you to create a post and connect it to a user.
