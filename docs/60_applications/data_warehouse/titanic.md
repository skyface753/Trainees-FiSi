# Titanic Kaggle Competition

## Getting started

First, follow the [tutorial](http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/) to get familiar with the data.

## Knime Workflow

Now you can download the [additional data](../../assets/data/dwt/Titanic%20Passenger%20list.xls){:download="Titanic Passenger list.xls"}.
These 2 excel sheets contain some additional information about the passengers.

You can create an Knime Workflow, which concatenates the data with the (train.csv) data from the tutorial.

## Machine Learning

You can than also create a random forest with Knime, to predict the survival of the passengers.
