# React Native

!!! warning

    Don't confuse [React](react.md) (Web UI framework) with [React Native](react_native.md) (Cross-platform mobile UI framework).

    - React Native is a separate framework, which is not based on React, but uses the same principles.
    - React Native is just for mobile, while React is for web.
