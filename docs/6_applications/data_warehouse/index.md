Data Warehouse Technology is the technology associated with data warehousing. It is a set of concepts and tools that allow the extraction of data from transactional systems, transform it into a format that can be analyzed, and loaded into a data warehouse for analysis.

## What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a system that stores data from a company's operational databases as well as external sources. It is a central repository of data in which data from various sources is stored. The data warehouse is then used for reporting and data analysis.

For example: `Amazon` has production databases that store information about customers, orders, products, etc. These are operational databases. Amazon also has a data warehouse that stores data from these operational databases as well as external sources. This data warehouse is then used for reporting and data analysis.
